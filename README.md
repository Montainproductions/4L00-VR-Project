# 4L00 Project

## Intro
As part of the Interactive arts and science (IASC) honors program there is a 4th year course that the students take which consists of roughly 15 students working coperativly for one entire school year for about 10 hours a week on a project that allows us to demonstrate our skill sets and create an interactive medium for people to experience something. If interested to read more about the project you can read our current GDD that is saved onto this repo.

## Description
H.O.M.E (The Hall of Mental-Health Experiences) is a VR museum experience which explores 5 different mental illnesses: OCD, PTSD, DDD, Panic Disorder, and Schizophrenia. Venture into these immersive experiences which emulate aspects of each mental illness. After going through a tour of one of the museumâ€™s rooms and diving deep into what one might experience with these mental illnesses, visitors will be brought to a specially designed coping room to guide them through helpful coping methods to bring them back from the intense experience. H.O.M.E seeks to unveil the stigmas and curtains that guard away what mental illness truly is by providing a real look into the minds of those that experience them. Are you ready to take a leap into H.O.M.E?
